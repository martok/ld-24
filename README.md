ld-24 @ BitSpace: Game Of Citylife
==================================

How to Play
-----------
Your goal is to create a big city. In doing so, you plan how to spend the limited space you have by choosing buildings to create on the 9 building spots in every city block.
See the ingame-info for details.

Requirements
------------
Graphics is OpenGL 2.0 (which any recent graphics hardware should have).

Sound requires OpenAL, which you can get from [CreateiveLabs](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/Forms/AllItems.aspx) or follow this direct [download link](http://connect.creativelabs.com/openal/Downloads/oalinst.zip).
